Author's Note:

_I'm not really huge "vtuber" guy, but wouldn't it be cool to have an expressive digital persona? From an outsider's perspective, it looks like all the mainstream apps and tools add so much bloat and complexity (i.e. game engines, plugins, protocols). I could be totally wrong, but let's just build and see._
